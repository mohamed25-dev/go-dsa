# go-dsa

A Go-based collection of practical data structure and algorithm implementations.

This repository includes:
- Clean implementations of core data structures (queue, stack, tree, etc.)
- Coding challenges solved using custom-built data structures (mainly from LeetCode)

I am planning to add more data structures and algorithms soon InshaaAllah.  
I will also include explanations, Big O analysis and common use cases for each data structure â€” so this repo can serve as a helpful guide for anyone learning DSA in general or with Go specifically.
